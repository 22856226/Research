Identify the mediator variable in the causal pathway A -> B -> C. This means if A causes B is true and B causes C is true, then B is the mediator. Only provide the mediator variable (B) without any additional explanation. 
In diagnosing neuropathic pain, consider the variables DLS C6-C7, R C7 Radikulopati, and R Under armsbesvär. Identify the mediator variable.

The causal chain here is: DLS C6-C7 causes R C7 Radikulopati discomfort is true.
R C7 Radikulopati causes R Under armsbesvär is true.
The causal pathway is DLS C6-C7 -> R C7 Radikulopati -> R Under armsbesvär,
