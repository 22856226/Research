Identify which variable is the collider. Only provide the collider name, strictly following the format: 'collider: [variable name]' Do not include any additional explanation.

### Input:
There are three variables: L L2 Radikulopati, L T10 Radikulopati, and Laterala bukbesvär. In the context of diagnosing neuropathic pain, consider the causal relationships where A or B may cause discomfort to the collider. This implies that A -> collider or B -> collider.

### Response:
