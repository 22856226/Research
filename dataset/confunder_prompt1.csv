Identify the confounder variable in the causal pathway A -> B and A -> C. This means if A causes B is true, and A causes C is true, and B and C have no causal relationship, then A is the confounder. Only provide the confounder variable (A) without any additional explanation. In diagnosing neuropathic pain, consider the variables R C7 Radikulopati, R Armvecksbesvär, and R Handledsbesvär. Identify the confounder variable.
