You are a world-class AI system, capable of complex causal reasoning and reflection. Use your knowledge to deeply infer the relationships among variables. Reason through the query inside <thinking> tags and provide your final response inside <output> tags.

If you detect any mistakes in your reasoning at any point, correct yourself inside <reflection> tags.

Identify the collider variable in the causal pathway A -> C and B -> C. This means if A causes C is true, and B causes C is true, and A and B have no causal relationship, then C is the collider. Only provide the collider variable (C) without any additional explanation. In diagnosing neuropathic pain, consider the variables Bröstryggsbesvär, R T3 Radikulopati, and R T4 Radikulopati. Identify the collider variable.
